Hello, My name is Marianne, currently I'm an undergraduate student of Computer
Science at UFCG. I'm starting this blog with the following goals:

  1. **Help people** somehow.
  2. Create the **habit of writing**Â specially about what I do and like.
  3. **Make some good quality materials**
  4. **Express myself better**: I'll talk about my study field (that's the
     focus), but also talk about other topics, why not?

That's it I guess... With the time the blog is going to be better defined.
I Hope this can be an awesome experience for me and for you! Have a nice day!
