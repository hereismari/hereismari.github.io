# My first Chrome Extension - SpotifYoutube

Hello, Stop the world, there's something very weeeird happening... after a
couple of very busy months I've got the time to start (and finish, I know I'm
as shocked as you) my first chrome extension. It's a simple extension that
adds a button to YouTube to search the youtube video title you're watching in
Spotify. I'm very proud of this, it's working properly and youtube is love,
spotify is love, this extension could not be any different!

Hope you enjoy it!
