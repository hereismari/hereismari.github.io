# Exploring MNIST with TensorFlow, from the very beginning to an Android Application

Hi everyone, I've recently started to study TensorFlow, and is such a great
framework and TensorBoard is amazing. But I'm not here to say how much awesome
it is (you know it), I'm here to talk about some of the things I've been doing
with TensorFlow.

Basically, the HelloWorld of TensorFlow is to build a model to classify [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) digits, so I created a repository
with a lot of links to cool MNIST tutorials (link in the end of this post),
some more simple and direct, others more complex.

And I've also created a repository for a handwritten digits classifier on
Android and how to build one on your own.

Hope it helps somehow, have a nice day!
