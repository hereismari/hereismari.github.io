            <ul>
            <li>
                Researched and developed methods for anomaly detection using Deep Learning.
                As result co-wrote the paper
                "A Generalized Active Learning Approach for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection"
                available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09411">arxiv</a>.

            <ul>
            <li>
                Developed a 3-hour TensorFlow programming workshop for
                developers new to Machine Learning. Presented at four events
                (including <a href="http://www.kdd.org/">KDD</a>,
                a top database conference) to >650 developers;
            </li>
            <li>
                Created educational resources to make it easier for developers
                to understand how to write Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
                in TensorFlow. This work was featured at two developer events,
                and soon to be published on the Google Developers blog;
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked with the Brain team to refine TensorFlow examples for
                distributed training and multiple GPUs. As a result there’s a
                well documented implementation accessible at
                <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10_estimator">tensorflow/models</a>
                and a detailed guide soon to be available on tensorflow.org.

            <p>
            Sahara allows remote HDFS, local HDFS, Swift, and Manila as
            data sources. However, there was no clean abstraction around them,
            and the code to deal with them is often very difficult to read and
            modify. I’ve created a clean abstraction of a data source and a
            job binary that each type can implement differently depending on
            its own needs. About 3000 lines of code were changed. More about it
