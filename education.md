## AI /ML GDE

I was the first AI / Machine Learning Google Developer Expert in Brazil (Sep 2017 to Oct 2019).

Google Developers Experts (GDEs) are a global network of experienced product strategists,
designers, developers and marketing professionals actively supporting developers, startups and
companies changing the world through technology.

### Some of my contributions

    I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@mariannelinharesm/">blogposts</a> about Machine Learning and
    TensorFlow newest trends, present talks and workshops to help people get started with TensorFlow and
    write readable and didactic code!
